<h1>Preparing for release</h1>
<div>
<p>When you are ready to release your expansion, be sure to ONLY INCLUDE files required by your expansion</p>
<p>This means any resource or file you made has to be included, but do not include AFBase files</p>
<p>We don't want 200 different versions of AFBase laying around so instead you will have to direct your users to download AFbase first in the release thread</p>
<p>also remember to include the lines for AFBaseExpansions.as, meaning: the include line "#include <AFBaseExpansions/(name)>" and the function call line "(name)_Call();"</p>
