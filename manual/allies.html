						<p>
							Your team mates in Sven Co-op (other players attempting the same mission) will commonly look similar to the figure on the right, though there are many character models to choose from. All players have exactly the same abilities as you, and can fight just as hard.
						</p>

						<p>
							It is essential that you co-operate with your team mates, as most Sven Co-op levels are a lot harder than the original Half-Life missions with stronger enemies and more combat. You may also need to work with your team mates to solve puzzles or to activate certain buttons.
						</p>

						<p>
							Communication with others helps ensure success, so before you play check your key setting for the <em>Chat Message</em> command (default <em>Y</em>) - better yet, if you have a microphone handy, use the control options menu to set a key for <em>Use Voice Communication</em> and hold the key in game to talk to team mates. Remember to use voice communication in respect of other players hearing!
						</p>

						<ul class="notes">
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> You cannot hurt or kill your team mates. Consider any attempt to do so as a waste of ammunition.</li>
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-tip.png" alt="Tip"> Some maps require a player to be <em>boosted</em> up to a higher ledge. This is where one player will crouch down by the higher platform allowing another player to jump on top to reach the higher area. It helps if players are kind and offer to boost others when required.</li>
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-tip.png" alt="Tip"> To help with boosting, some maps enable a new feature called <em>auto climbing</em>. This is done by jumping against a wall of a higher area, and depending on the height of the area, you can boost yourself up on top of it.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Some players will have icons beside them on the score board. This denotes players who are donors or members of the Sven Co-op team as follows:
						</p>

						<ul class="simple">
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/1donor.png" alt="Donor"> Donor ($5+) with electric crowbar extra.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/2donor.png" alt="Donor"> Donor ($8+) with electric crowbar and gold Uzi extras.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/3donor.png" alt="Donor"> Donor ($20+) with electric crowbar and gold Uzi extras.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/4contributor.png" alt="Contributor / tester"> Game contributor / internal tester.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/5artist.png" alt="Artist"> Game artist (maps, models, sounds, etc)</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/6developer.png" alt="Developer"> Game developer / co-ordinator.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							On the far right of the score board you may find players with the server administrator icon <img class="icon" src="images/icons/server_admin.png" alt="Server administrator">, which means this person helps run and maintain the game server you're playing on. They are your first point of contact if you are having any trouble while playing on their game server. This icon may be tinted <span style="color: gold;">gold</span> <img class="icon" src="images/icons/server_owner.png" alt="Server owner"> to signify that the person owns the game server.

			<a id="interaction"></a><h2>Interaction</h2>

			<p>
				In order to help your team complete missions effectively with allied characters, there are a set of commands you can use (and bind to a key) to interact with the allied characters around.
			</p>

			<p>
				All allied characters will follow the players in the same way scientists or Barney does in regular Half-Life. Simply use them once to make them follow you, then use them again to make them stay where they are.
			</p>

			<p>
				All allies that are following you can now be given simple commands. You can set keys to these commands in the control options.
			</p>

					<td class="td2">Alerts other players that they should take cover. This will automatically perform the <em>npc_findcover</em> command too.</td>
					<td class="td1">X</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>
				There are some combinations you can set on these keys for better interaction, for example:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>bind X "grenade; say_team Look out!"</em></li>
				<li><em>bind Z "medic; npc_return; say_team Medic please."</em></li>
			</ul>

			<ul class="notes">
				<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> Friendly opposing force grunts are dressed in jungle camouflage, and hostile opposing force grunts are dressed in the standard white urban camouflage. While this is different from opposing force, this is necessary to keep the same style as the standard grunts in Sven Co-op. Just remember, green is good, white is bad.</li>
				<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> Players caught by Barnacles will not be able to call for aid. Other players will only hear a struggle.</li>
