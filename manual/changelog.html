			<h2><a id="new"></a>Notable features</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Sven Co-op is now its own independent game distributed on Steam, free of charge.
					<ul>
						<li>Includes 3 packages: A game package for players, a tool package for dedicated server operators, and an SDK package for content developers.</li>
						<li>Includes use of the Steam game hub platform and community features. <em>(workshop functionality to be included in a future release)</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Sven Co-op now uses a customized GoldSrc engine under licence from Valve.
					<ul>
						<li>Gives us the opportunity to improve upon common limitations in the GoldSrc engine.</li>
						<li>Maps can now be up to ~1,000x larger! (131,072 units away from position zero instead of just 4,096)</li>
						<li>Mappers: See the <a href="#code-engine">engine changes</a> section for more details and technical information.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>New build of all Half-Life maps for co-operative play.
					<ul>
						<li>All maps re-ported from scratch for Sven Co-op from Half-Life: Source.</li>
						<li>Enabled cross-map inventory.</li>
						<li>Enabled survival game play mode with checkpoints, so players have to be more careful about staying alive and reviving fallen allies.</li>
						<li>Many maps have been merged into a single map on a per-chapter basis to reduce map changes.</li>
						<li>The game play is now much more pure, with no "kill monsters to proceed" gates.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV1KH0SrvDA">New inventory system</a> by using the new entity <em><a href="#code-item-inventory">item_inventory</a></em>, which is an item that a player holds on to for trigger rules and/or side-effects. Some example possibilities:
					<ul>
						<li>A key item must be carried by a player to a locked door, rather than it instantly becoming unlocked for rushers to wait by.</li>
						<li>A bomb defuse kit has to be brought to a bomb to defuse it, or it explodes and you all die.</li>
						<li>A gas mask can protect a player from nerve gas, but only lasts 2 minutes.</li>
						<li>Did someone say Capture the Flag??</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>New maps:
					<ul>
						<li>Black Mesa: Special Tactics Sector.</li>
						<li>Desert Circle.</li>
						<li>Fortified.</li>
						<li>Stadium 4.</li>
						<li>Turret Fortress: Reverse.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Updated maps:
					<ul>
						<li>Toon Run: Added extensive new areas, and reworked some of the old areas.</li>
						<li>Momma Mesa: Added six new possible endings, a new final boss battle, and new music.
						<li>Another Unit: Added survival mode with checkpoints.</li>
						<li>YABMA: Added survival mode with checkpoints.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><a href="#model">New models</a> for many weapons, ammo, and NPCs.</li>
				<li>New modifiers/effects that can be applied/removed on players and NPCs via inventory items, and scripts, and custom (scripted) entities:
					<ul>
						<li>Block use of weapons.</li>
						<li>Damage modifier.</li>
						<li>Extra / less time before starting to drown.</li>
						<li>Friction modifier.</li>
						<li>Ghost / non-solid.</li>
						<li>Glow shell.</li>
						<li>Gravity modifier.</li>
						<li>Invisibility.</li>
						<li>Invulnerability.</li>
						<li>Speed modifier.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>New observer mode:
					<ul>
						<li>Standard mode: If no spawn points are available for a player to use they become an observer until a spawn point becomes available.</li>
						<li>Cyclic mode: Players can only respawn out of observer mode when the map explicitly requests so.</li>
						<li>Survival game mode places dead players into observer mode until a live player reaches a checkpoint.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>New preliminary A.I. pathing entities for better control on where NPCs move around a map.</li>
				<li>New scripting engine using <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/">AngelScript</a>:
					<ul>
						<li>Version 2.30.2 implemented.</li>
						<li>New entity: <em>trigger_script</em></li>
						<li>A map script can be loaded by specifying a file in the map's configuration using key <em>map_script</em>.</li>
						<li>Scripts can be triggered one off or periodically (thinking).</li>
						<li>Alternative script files can be used, and shared across maps.</li>
						<li>New survival game play mode driven by a shared script.</li>
						<li>Watch out in future change logs as <em>many more updates</em> will come with this!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>New weapon: Displacer from Opposing Force.</li>
				<li>Player weapons/ammunition can now be <a href="#code-carry-stuff-across-maps">carried across map changes</a>. (if a map wants to do this)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2><a id="code"></a>Code changes</h2>

			<h3><a id="code-core"></a>Game core</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Added a more graceful way to close servers when an error occurs, most notably listen servers will return the host player to the main menu rather than terminate the process.</li>
				<li>Added a spawn flag to <em>func_clip</em> so it can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX1GFNGsIaA">block players from throwing an inventory item through them</a>.</li>
				<li>Added a spawn flag to <em>trigger_hurt</em> to hurt non-moving NPCs.</li>
				<li>Added a spawn flag to <em>trigger_respawn</em> only respawn dead players.</li>
				<li>Added a spawn flag to <em>trigger_track_goal</em> to prevent the train moving backwards if it can't find a path to direct the train to.</li>
				<li>Added an optional sound to <em>trigger_track_goal</em> if it can't find a path to direct the train to.</li>
				<li>Added announcement when a player joins a server (as they enter the world after connecting, not when they start connecting) to match the message when players leave.</li>
				<li>Added custom amount, recharge time, sounds, and trigger properties to health/HEV chargers.</li>
				<li>Added custom HUD sprite configurations for weapons.</li>
				<li>Added custom sound file and sentence properties to buttons, doors, platforms, trains, and track trains.</li>
				<li>Added custom text options for the buttons via <em>trigger_vote</em>.</li>
				<li>Added fall-back to the studio model renderer sequence group loader so it can find the sequence group by using the actual model name, instead of the embedded (and frequently incorrect) names.</li>
				<li>Added <em>IsNotAmmoItem</em> to weapons so they aren't taken (and removed from the map) for ammo when <em>mp_weaponstay</em> is disabled.</li>
				<li>Added key to <em>monster_generic</em>: "disableai", disables all monster and AI behaviour. (Effectively turns it into a prop)</li>
				<li>Added key to <em>trigger_teleport</em>: "teleport_if_blocked", when enabled the teleporter will send the source entity even if the teleporter exit is blocked.</li>
				<li>Added key to <em>trigger_teleport</em>: "teleport_ignore_delay", when enabled the teleporter ignores all delays (implicitly sets flag 8,192).</li>
				<li>Added key to <em>trigger_teleport</em>: "teleport_start_inactive", when enabled the teleporter starts inactive (implicitly sets flag 4,096).</li>
				<li>Added map configuration and text files to the pre-cache list if they exist, so they will be transferred to clients (this excludes those with the <em>CFG</em> extension as that is a security restriction).</li>
				<li>Added message box support for non-Windows platforms using SDL, mimicking the Windows button sets and response/event codes.</li>
				<li>Added missing calls to entity destructor functions for Baby Gargantuas and alien slaves so their effect entities can be cleaned up from an unexpected destruction.</li>
				<li>Added opaque character drawing to <em>game_text</em> by specifying an alpha value of 1 or higher in either colour keys.</li>
				<li>Added parameter <em>use type</em> (on/off/set/toggle/kill) and <em>value</em> to cheat command <em>trigger</em>.</li>
				<li>Added player percentage requirement to <em>trigger_changelevel</em>.</li>
				<li>Added <em>show HUD info</em> to any entity.</li>
				<li>Added support to <em>trigger_respawn</em> for "!activator" and "!caller" as targets. (Only works for players right now)</li>
				<li>Allied NPCs can now not be given a weapon by the map.</li>
				<li>Changed chat messages from the server console to show the source as <em>Server Console</em> and in orange rather than printing the entire server name.</li>
				<li>Changed cheat command <em>impulse 101</em> (<em>giveall</em>) to provide 5 spores instead of 1.</li>
				<li>Changed command <em>time</em> and <em>timelimit</em> to specify if there is no time limit for the map, and checks map CVAR <em>mp_notimelimit</em>.</li>
				<li>Changed default map to <em>svencoop1</em> instead of <em>hldm1</em> if a map cycle map (or a map cycle file) isn't found.</li>
				<li>Changed <em>env_sound</em> so that they can be used with brush triggers:
					<ul>
						<li>Added a spawn flag <em>use only</em> (1) will disable automatic activation based on proximity.</li>
						<li>When triggered if the radius setting is 0, no radius check will happen and the effect is applied.</li>
						<li>When triggered if the radius setting is not 0, a radius check will happen so the effect is applied only if the player is within radius.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Changed <em>func_tank</em> so it will return to its original orientation when it no longer has any enemies around to fire at.</li>
				<li>Changed <em>trigger_cdaudio</em> to use an MP3 file rather than try and look for a physical CD.</li>
				<li>Changed game version mismatch to create a pop-up message and disconnect rather than force the game to quit.</li>
				<li>Changed how <em>func_train</em> handles being blocked so it doesn't stop moving for 0.5 seconds every time it gets blocked. Instead, damage is applied every 0.5 seconds to compensate for the otherwise per-frame damage.</li>
				<li>Changed maps with player model enforcement to write the player choice model in "cl_model" instead of "team" in the client info string.</li>
				<li>Changed word <em>executing</em> for <em>parsing</em> when loading skill and static configurations, as these files are not directly executed.</li>
				<li>Cheat commands that are blocked are now denoted that they were a cheat command in the server log.</li>
				<li>Completely refactored the in game Media Player, including many fixes for crashes, glitches, and memory leaks.</li>
				<li>Disabled map restart when a player respawns whilst CVAR's <em>coop</em> and <em>deathmatch</em> are both disabled.</li>
				<li>Disabled "&lt;monster&gt; has no view_ofs!" debug message.</li>
				<li>Dropped items will now only bounce up to 15 times on the ground, then stop moving. (Fixes insane network traffic from dropped items stuck in steep wedges)</li>
				<li>Expanded command <em>myinfo</em> to show your health, maximum health, armor, maximum armor, player state (alive/dead/observer), score, deaths, network defined entity name, game extras level (and optional title), server administrator level, and a count/list of enabled cheats.</li>
				<li>Expanded command <em>mapinfo</em> to show you the number of entities currently in existence and the number of pre-cached models/sprites (along with their respective limits).</li>
				<li>Fixed 1 round of ammo inexplicably getting lost when dropping a weapon with an odd amount of reserve ammo.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when a map has no configuration file in some cases.</li>

				<li>Reduced <em>trigger_copyvalue</em> interval to limit memory/crash issues.</li>
				<li>Re-factored <em>trigger_setorigin</em> with a new EndFrame() engine call for more accurate synchronisation.</li>
				<li>Remapped usage of HUD text message channels in accordance with the <a href="#hud-msg-channels">raised channel count</a> from the engine:
					<ul>
						<li><em>1</em>: Spare, should be used by plug-ins -- particularly those that want to produce constant on-screen text.</li>
						<li><em>2</em>: Identification message from game staff.</li>
						<li><em>3</em>: Banana attack!!</li>
						<li><em>4</em>: Monster/NPC on-screen information.</li>
						<li><em>5-8</em>: Virtual channel slots 1-4 for map messages (<em>game_text</em>), should never be used by plug-ins!</li>
					</ul>

				<li>Removed landmark entity.</li>
				<li>Removed outdated NOVODEX functionality causing clients to freeze for a while after loading a map.</li>

			<h3><a id="code-engine"></a>Game engine</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Independent engine branch based on Valve's GoldSrc/Half-Life engine (version 1.1.2.2 build 6027) with SteamPipe. Modified under licence from Valve Corporation.</li>
				<li>New launchers:
					<ul>
						<li><em>svencoop.exe</em>: Game launcher.</li>
						<li><em>svends.exe</em> / <em>svends_run</em>: Dedicated server launcher.</li>
						<li>Default game folder is now <em>"svencoop"</em> from "valve".</li>
						<li>Improved detail to many of the obscure error messages, for example when Steam isn't running but needs to be, or you haven't subscribed to the game via Steam.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>New limits (engine core):
					<ul>
						<li><em>Maximum base decals</em>: Raised to <em>1,024</em> from 256.</li>
						<li><em>Maximum beams</em>: Raised to <em>256</em> from 64.</li>
						<li><em>Maximum dynamic/entity lights</em>: Raised to <em>256</em> from 64.</li>
						<li><em>Maximum edicts</em>: Raised to <em>8,192</em> from 900 (though the engine may become unstable beyond ~2,500).</li>
						<li><em>Maximum frame rate</em>: Raised to <em>200</em> from 100 (for 120Hz/144Hz monitors). You can still get up to 1,000 frames/second with developer mode enabled.</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>New limits (for maps):
					<ul>
						<li><em>Maximum brushes</em>: Raised to <em>32,767</em> from 8,192.</li>
						<!--<li><em>Maximum clip nodes</em>: Raised to <em>65,536</em> from 32,767.</li>-->
						<li><em>Maximum edicts</em>: Raised to <em>8,192</em> from 1,024 (though the engine may become unstable beyond ~2,500).</li>
						<li><em>Maximum entity key size</em>: Raised to <em>256</em> from 32.</li>
						<li><em>Maximum entity value size</em>: Raised to <em>4096</em> from 1024.</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Networking changes:
					<ul>
						<li>All datagrams now leave enough room for IPv6 headers.</li>
						<li><em>Default maximum network rate</em>: Raised to <em>20,000 bytes/second</em> instead of 2,500.</li>
						<li><em>Maximum datagram length</em>: Raised to <em>65,536 bytes</em> from 1,400.</li>
						<li><em>Maximum entities per packet</em>: Raised to <em>512</em> from from 256.</li>

						<li><em>Message sequence size</em>: Raised to <em>2 bytes</em> from 1 byte.</li>
						<li>Fixed an unexpected disconnect if a custom network message couldn't be found. Instead a warning is printed to their console.</li>
						<li>Mod-level network messages are now loaded directly after the server has activated to prevent some missing message issues.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Smarter heap memory allocation mechanism:
					<ul>
						<li>Default heap memory size is now half of all available virtually addressable memory but only up to <em>512MB</em> from 40MB (for clients) or 32MB (for servers).</li>
						<li>Default heap memory size will step down by 16MB decrements until enough memory can be allocated by the host system.</li>
						<li>If the engine can't obtain the minimum required memory from the host system it will refuse to start.</li>
						<li>Compiled launchers with the <em>large address aware</em> flag so that up to 3GB of memory can be consumed on 32-bit Windows systems (if the /3GB boot switch is used), and up to 4GB on 64-bit Windows systems. Both up from their previous 2GB limit.</li>
						<li>Launch parameter <em>-heapsize</em> can now be written in MB/GB (i.e. -heapsize 256M or -heapsize 1G).</li>
						<li>Launch parameter <em>-maxmemory</em> will force the engine to take as much memory as it can from the host system.</li>
						<li>Launch parameter <em>-minmemory</em> will force the engine to take as little memory as it can from the host system.</li>
						<li>Launch parameter <em>-showheap</em> will notify you how much memory was successfully allocated from the host system.</li>
						<li>Stack size increased to <em>8MB</em> from 1MB.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Added <em>addons</em> SteamPipe folder to the default resource search list. Use parameter <em>-noaddons</em> to disable this.</li>

				<li>Added new key mappings for joystick axis (so analogue L/R triggers can be bound to a command).</li>
				<li>Added referral address for content downloads over HTTP so web servers can prevent leeching.</li>
				<li>Added server command <em>logaddress_list</em> to list all current log forwarders (useful for external log managers).</li>
				<li>Added server CVAR <em>listipcfgfile</em> as a pointer to file <em>listip.cfg</em>, works the same as CVAR <em>bannedcfgfile</em>.</li>
				<li>Added server CVAR <em>sv_log_daily</em> to enable daily rotation of server log files rather than a new file for every map played.</li>
				<li>Added support for raw mouse input provided by SDL2.</li>
				<li>Added wild-card search functionality for entity targets.</li>
				<li>Changed host error message backwards mins/maxs to include the entity origin and the offending values.</li>
				<li>Changed the default console position and size so it consumes the right side of the screen with a slight border, similar to that of the Source engine.</li>
				<li>Changed the <em>snapshot</em> command:
					<ul>
						<li>Screen shots are now saved in a sub-folder <em>screenshots</em>.</li>
						<li>File names now include a date stamp <em>YYYY-MM-DD</em>.</li>
						<li>File names now indexed from <em>1-9999</em> instead of 0-1000.</li>
						<li>Added success message to the console showing you what file name the screen shot got saved as.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Cheat and debugging commands/CVAR's (such as <em>gl_wireframe</em>) provided by the engine can now be used in multi-player games if the server is running CVAR "<em>sv_cheats</em>" at level 255.</li>
				<li>Console command auto-complete now shows up to 20 entries, and will pop out to the side if it's too long to show below.</li>
				<li>Console debug log (<em>-condebug</em>) file name is now rotated daily.</li>
				<li>EndFrame() is called directly after a physics loop if the game (mod) chooses to implement it.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash if a brush model index is higher than 999 (due to a 4 character limit).</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash if a camera/viewport is accessed when a player retries connecting to the server.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash if an entity doesn't exist while trying to find an attachment point on it.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash if an external model/sprite file is missing by replacing it for an <em>ERROR</em> variant with an error about the missing resource written in the console, though a crash will occur if the error replacement is also missing.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash if map entity data has a comment between two entities.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when reading a setting from the Windows registry overflows.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when a memory allocation fails (and no indication was given to why the engine crashed).</li>

				<li>Fixed alert messages being shown on the client when developer mode is disabled.</li>
				<li>Fixed an issue with "force retouch" not being applied correctly to all NPCs (mainly used by monster_tentacle), depending on when force retouch is enabled in the main physics/entity processing loop. (Force retouch now works for the next available frame, so that it can be applied consistently to all entities.)</li>
				<li>Fixed chrome textures not scaling up correctly with models, particularly NPCs.</li>
				<li>Fixed entity collision detection stopping immediately as soon as it finds an entity that should not collide, instead of processing other entities wanting to collide.</li>

				<li><a id="hud-msg-channels"></a>Raised HUD text message channels to <em>8</em> from 4.
					<ul>
						<li>The new 4 channels are reserved for map use (via <em>game_text</em>). All existing maps will automatically use these, no updates to maps needed.</li>
						<li>The first (original) 4 are for internal use by the game engine/library.</li>
						<li>This means that messages produced by mappers will never be missed/overwritten by a message produced by the game or a plug-in.</li>
						<li>Channel 1 is unused by any of the game and should be the primary choice for plug-ins.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Re-added client DLL CRC checking so that mods using our engine branch can still enforce client consistency (controlled by Liblist entry <em>crcclientdll</em>).</li>
				<li>Removed <em>gl_clear</em> from list of cheat variables to disable.
					<ul>
						<li>This is now on by default.</li>
						<li>Default colour is now black instead of red.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Removed some redundant network code to improve its reliability greatly.</li>
				<li>Server will now flush the log file buffer every minute rather than when the handle is closed to minimize how much log data is lost when a server crashes.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><a id="code-sound"></a>Sound engine</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Added material definitions for textures from Blue Shift, Opposing Force, Opposing Force CTF, and Team Fortress Classic.</li>
				<li>Improved reliability of sounds playing from an origin outside a player's PAS/PVS.</li>
				<li>Changed CODEC order when looking for sentence sound files, so that lossless and higher quality CODEC's are used first.</li>
				<li>Custom materials can now be transported to players:
					<ul>
						<li>Materials file defined by <em>materials_file</em> either in the map properties or configuration file.</li>
						<li>Standard relative path is <em>/sound/&lt;bspname&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</em>.</li>

				<li>Fixed sound cache files not being flushed from alternative game folders (such as <em>_downloads</em> or <em>_french</em>).</li>
				<li>Fixed sound files not being loaded from Steam Pipe folders.</li>
				<li>Fixed sounds still playing after disconnecting or during a map change.</li>
				<li>Improved handling when sound devices are connected/disconnected.</li>
				<li>New client CVAR <em>s_force_dsound</em> to force FMOD to use DirectSound instead of WASAPI (applies to Windows Vista and later, XP and earlier always uses DirectSound).</li>
				<li>Output is now muted whilst the game window is not in focus (Windows only).</li>
				<li>Overhauled lip sync by using a better wave dataset to work with.</li>
				<li>Reduced memory consumption with the sound replacement feature.</li>
				<li>Removed entity <em>trigger_midi</em>.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><a id="code-carry-stuff-across-maps"></a>Added ability for <em>trigger_changelevel</em> to make players carry weapons/ammo across maps by setting key <em>keep_inventory</em> to 1.
