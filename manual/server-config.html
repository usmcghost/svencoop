			<h1>Running a server (configuration guide)</h1>

			<p>
				This section will go over all the settings you will need to run a dedicated (or listen) server. Please refer to the included file <em>server_example.cfg</em> (or <em>listenserver_example.cfg</em>), and I will take you through each setting in groups as already specified.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you have not yet set up a server and need instructions to help you, please see our <a href="server-basic.html">server installation guide</a>.
