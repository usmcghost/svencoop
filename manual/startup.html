			<h1>Start up guide</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>
				Sven Co-op is a co-operative based game based around Valve Software's Half-Life. In this game players must work together against computer controlled enemies and solve puzzles as a team.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is ideal that you are at least familiar with Half-Life and its controls, and it is recommended that you have completed Half-Life's hazard course.
			</p>

			<p>
				While Sven Co-op is similar to Half-Life with similar weapons, monsters, and characters, the difficulty has been increased to suit team play.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sven Co-op's levels are set as missions and are generally separate from each other. Many missions span several maps and some are collected together in a series. The aim of most levels is to reach the end or to achieve an objective -- obtaining a high score is not essential to beat a level, its just part of the fun.
			</p>

				<li>Launch Steam and log in.</li>

			</p>

			<h2>The players</h2>

			<table class="wide entities-with-picture">
				<tr>
					<td class="description">
						<p>
							Your team mates in Sven Co-op (other players attempting the same mission) will commonly look similar to the figure on the right, though there are many character models to choose from. All players have exactly the same abilities as you, and can fight just as hard.
						</p>

						<p>
							It is essential that you co-operate with your team mates, as most Sven Co-op levels are a lot harder than the original Half-Life missions with stronger enemies and more combat. You may also need to work with your team mates to solve puzzles or to activate certain buttons.
						</p>

						<p>
							Communication with others helps ensure success, so before you play check your key setting for the <em>Chat Message</em> command (default <em>Y</em>) - better yet, if you have a microphone handy, use the control options menu to set a key for <em>Use Voice Communication</em> and hold the key in game to talk to team mates. Remember to use voice communication in respect of other players hearing!
						</p>

						<ul class="notes">
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> You cannot hurt or kill your team mates. Consider any attempt to do so as a waste of ammunition.</li>
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-tip.png" alt="Tip"> Some maps require a player to be <em>boosted</em> up to a higher ledge. This is where one player will crouch down by the higher platform allowing another player to jump on top to reach the higher area. It helps if players are kind and offer to boost others when required.</li>
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-tip.png" alt="Tip"> To help with boosting, some maps enable a new feature called <em>auto climbing</em>. This is done by jumping against a wall of a higher area, and depending on the height of the area, you can boost yourself up on top of it.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Some players will have icons beside them on the score board. This denotes players who are donors or members of the Sven Co-op team as follows:
						</p>

						<ul class="simple">
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/1donor.png" alt="Donor"> Donor ($5+) with electric crowbar extra.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/2donor.png" alt="Donor"> Donor ($8+) with electric crowbar and gold Uzi extras.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/3donor.png" alt="Donor"> Donor ($20+) with electric crowbar and gold Uzi extras.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/4contributor.png" alt="Contributor / tester"> Game contributor / internal tester.</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/5artist.png" alt="Artist"> Game artist (maps, models, sounds, etc)</li>
							<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/6developer.png" alt="Developer"> Game developer / co-ordinator.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							On the far right of the score board you may find players with the server administrator icon <img class="icon" src="images/icons/server_admin.png" alt="Server administrator">, which means this person helps run and maintain the game server you're playing on. They are your first point of contact if you are having any trouble while playing on their game server. This icon may be tinted <span style="color: gold;">gold</span> <img class="icon" src="images/icons/server_owner.png" alt="Server owner"> to signify that the person owns the game server.

			<h2>The monsters</h2>

			<table class="wide entities-with-picture">

					<td class="description">
						<p>
							Stopping you from achieving your objectives are the computer controlled <em>monsters</em> (AI enemies). These appear in greater numbers than players and are a lot smarter than they were the original Half-Life, with new tactics and abilities. In most cases, monsters are hostile and should be killed as soon as possible. Occasionally however, you will meet <em>friendly</em> (player allied) monsters, who can follow you and attack your enemies (more on that later).
						</p>

						<p>
							Sometimes these monsters may be similar to generic Half-Life monsters, but in other cases they may be stronger, faster or have new attacks. When playing a new map, you can never be certain of what you might find yourself up against.
						</p>

						<ul class="notes">
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> For a full list of enemies in Sven Co-op check the <a href="enemies.html">enemies listing</a></li>
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> Sven Co-op features monster replacement technology, allowing level designers to add unique monsters to their maps (i.e. Axis soldiers in AfrikaKorps and sharks in Incoming)</li>

			<h2>The allies</h2>

			<table class="wide entities-with-picture">
				<tr>
					<td class="description">
					<p>
						Not all computer controlled monsters are out to kill you -- some monsters will work with you against hostile monsters. To identify these allies, use the in game <em>Friend or Foe system</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Simply point your cross hairs at a monster then information will show up in the bottom-left corner of your screen. If the monster is going to attack you the information will show up red. If it is green the monster is an ally and will help you. Real players will show up in blue. The <em>Friend or Foe system</em> also provides useful information about a monster or player's health and name.
					</p>

					<p>
						Certain maps may have disabled this feature. Typically this is enabled, though a map author can control this feature for their map.

					<ul class="notes">

							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-tip.png" alt="Tip"> <em>Friendly</em> monsters can follow you just as Barney can, and even be given some simple orders. This is also explained on the <a href="allies.html">allies listing</a></li>

			<h2>The weapons / equipment</h2>

			<table class="wide entities-with-picture">
				<tr>
					<td class="description">
					<p>
						Upon respawning or joining the game players are normally given a preset range of equipment and ammo. The type and amount varies between maps. It is also possible to pick up new weapons, ammo, and equipment in a map. The weapons you can pick up are generally better than your starting equipment and you should keep an eye out for them.
					</p>

					<p>
						Players have the ability to share weapons and ammo with team mates using the drop weapon/ammo keys definable in the control options, so make sure to share in difficult scenarios to help with your chances for survival.
					</p>

					<ul class="notes">
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-tip.png" alt="Tip"> In many maps equipment is stored at or near the spawn location. If you find yourself running low on ammo, you may wish to backtrack to your starting location in order to restock.</li>
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> For a full list of weapons and equipment in Sven Co-op check the <a href="weapons.html">weapons and equipment listing</a></li>
							<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> Sven Co-op features weapon replacement technology, allowing each map to include its own unique weapons (WW2-era weapons in AfrikaKorps, for example). These weapons will usually work in a similar way to the default weapons, but may deal out drastically different amounts of damage.</li>
						</ul></td>

			<h2>The music</h2>

			<p>
				Thanks to the new FMod sound library from Firelight Technologies more than just MP3 files can be played using the in-game music player.
			</p>

			<p>
				Use the included play list editor tool "<em>playlist.exe</em>" to easily create a list of music files or import a play list to use in the in-game player.
			</p>

			<p>
				In case you're having trouble running this tool, all you should need is <em>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5</em>. This is available free of charge for all Windows users:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>via the <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">Windows Update</a> website for Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 users.</li>
				<li>via the <em>Windows Update</em> tool (Start &raquo; All Programs) for Windows Vista, 2008, 7, 2008 R2, 8, and 8.1 users.</li>
				<li>via the <em>Programs and Features</em> control panel for Windows 10 users.</li>
