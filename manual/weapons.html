				Full listing of all the weapons you will get to use.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can share your ammo from most weapons with other players with the <em>dropammo</em> command. <em>H</em> is a good key to put this on.

					<p>
						The half-life crowbar has been improved in Sven Co-op. Donors gain the special feature to add electric damage to their crowbar. The electric crowbar is powered through your HEV armor battery and will drain power from that source every time you successfully hit a player, ally, or enemy.

						The combat knife featured in Opposing Force acts as a direct replacement for the crowbar, and is officially available to other maps. It functions exactly the same as the crowbar, but has a higher attack rate due to its lower weight.

					<p>
						The medkit is designed to help keep your team mates alive through the worst that can be thrown at them. Simply move close to a player that needs healing, and "fire" the medkit at them to instantly heal 10 health points. The medkit will be emptied quickly if lots of people need healing, but it will slowly recharge itself. You can also refill it quickly using wall-mounted health chargers once your own health is full.
					</p>
					<p>
						To revive a dead player or friendly NPC, your medkit will need to have at least 50 health points stored. Get close to the other player or NPC and use the secondary fire to revive them.
					</p>
					<ul class="notes">

						<li>Secondary fire: <em>Toggle between pull/rappel mode</em></li>
						<li>Ammo: <em>None</em></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Barnacle is used to help players reach areas that are too high to jump. It can only attach to players, certain monsters, and certain Xen surfaces (as shown on the right).
					</p>
					<p>
						The way the Barnacle grapple works is defined by the map creator. On some maps, it will only attach to small monsters. On others, it will pull monsters to you instead of the other way around.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unique to the Sven Co-op version of the Barnacle grapple, players can either be pulled by the grapple, or be dropped slowly (rappel), depending on what mode is chosen.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, the Barnacle grapple can also be used to eat monsters similar to a regular Barnacle. The difference is the grapple is much smaller, thus takes much longer to kill an enemy. This bite is only effective against very small monsters, such as headcrabs.
					</p>
					<ul class="notes">
						<li><img class="note" src="images/icon-note.png" alt="Note"> You can grapple onto your fellow players allowing you to, for example, boost another player onto a ledge then grapple up to the ledge yourself.

You could even use the barnacle to hold onto another player as he swings through a tricky grapple course.</li>

						The uzi is a very fast submachine gun with a 32 round clip that does a lot of damage very quickly, however your ammo is used up very fast.

						You can increase the accuracy considerably by enabling the barrel-mounted laser pointer at the cost of a slower fire rate.

						The MP5A3 is a light submachine gun, which holds 30 round clips. It has a mounted scope for zooming and a relatively high rate of fire. That and the low reloading time makes it an effective assault weapon.

					</ul>
					<p>
						The SPAS-12 shotgun offers very powerful blasts in single or automatic fire of 8 rounds. Automatic fire (gas operated) takes only a matter of seconds in to use all 8 shells, making it an extremely powerful weapon. It takes a little longer to reload, so make sure you have enough cover to do so. Automatic mode is also less accurate than single shots.

						The crossbow is a long-range stealth weapon holding 5 bolts. It hardly makes noise and has a mounted scope for long range attacks.

					<p>
						While not using the zoom, bolts will explode when hitting something solid. Bolts never explode when the crossbow is zoomed, or if a bolt hits a target.

					</ul>
					<p>
						The gauss gun is an experimental weapon fabricated in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Primary fire is an energy beam. You can charge up the weapon for a more powerful shot by holding secondary fire.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a very high knock back from maximum charged shots. Most maps will allow this knock back to allow the player to jump to much higher areas.

					<p>
						Stripped from an alien grunt, the player can use this weapon to fire up to 100 live hornets. Primary fire will launch a homing hornet that will seek its target, whereas secondary fire will launch hornets in quick succession directly where the player is aiming.
					</p>

						A creature from <a href="enemies.html#racex">race X</a> that fires spores from its mouth also thrown by shock troopers. The spore creates a large acid splash on explosion.
					</p>
					<p>
						The spores will bounce for a distance, then stop. They explode on player/NPC contact or after 4 seconds of being fired.
					</p>
					<p>
						This artillery support weapon is best used in open spaces to avoid hurting yourself.

						A shock roach from <a href="enemies.html#racex">race X</a> found in the hands of shock troopers can be picked up and used by players once it leaves its dying host.
					</p>
					<p>
						Due to the fast self-destructing nature of shock roaches, you must drop yours to be able to select another weapon (set a key to <em>drop weapon</em> in the control options, or bind any key to <em>drop</em> -- usually <em>G</em>).
