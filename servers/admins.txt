// List your server administrators in this file to mark them with an icon in the
// scoreboard.
//
// This file is re-directable using server CVAR "adminsfile".
//
// One auth ID per line, though comments are accepted. Max ID length is 44.
// Example: STEAM_0:1:FRIENDID	# FriendName
// An administrator can perform a command against players (non-admins) only.
//
// Denote the server owner by putting an asterisk * infront of the auth ID.
// Example: *STEAM_0:1:YOURID	# YourName
// An owner can perform a command against a standard administrator, and will
// have their icon tinted gold in the score board.
//
// The auth ID token is ended either by a new line, space, tab, #, or /
// You do not need to enter STEAM_ID_LOOPBACK or VALVE_ID_LOOPBACK. A listen
// server hosting player is automatically denoted as an owner.
