// This player ban list can be shared among all your servers. To include it
// within a server, add this line to their "servercfgfile":
//
// exec "servers/banned.cfg"
//
// DO NOT SET CVAR "bannedcfgfile" TO POINT TO THIS! Otherwise a ban you create
// on a specific server will overwrite this file entirely. You need to add bans
// to this shared list manually.
