// This file will contain player bans for this server only. You should set CVAR
// "bannedcfgfile" to point to this file. Any bans created with "writeid" will
// then be written here.
//
// If you use a shared bans file you should migrate new bans from here to your
// shared bans file, then remove them from this one.
