// This IP address ban list can be shared among all your servers. To include it
// within a server, add this line to their "servercfgfile":
//
// exec "servers/listip.cfg"
//
// DO NOT SET CVAR "listip" TO POINT TO THIS! Otherwise a ban you create on a
// specific server will overwrite this file entirely. You need to add bans to
// this shared list manually.
